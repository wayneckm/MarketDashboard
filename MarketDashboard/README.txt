In this program, I make a market dashboard with Ruby and Sinatra.

The procedures are as follows:
1) Read the csv file by using CSV library
2) Perform data manipulations and calculations in main.rb
3) Pass the table of results and display in a webpage by using ERB in Sinatra
4) Format and show the table of results in HTML

The local address of the webpage is http://localhost:4567/MarketDashboard

Screen capture of the table is also attached.
